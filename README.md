# OurMagicSandbox
This describes our implementation of the Magic Sandbox using open source code.
The documentation includes annotated version of the open source implementation description based on our experience using the open source 
code.
There are also various interim bits of information on temporary support frame and other work done in working towards the final implementation.

Thanks to all that made this possible - apologies if I missed anyone. (links are in the ppt deck)

To the original sandbox, implemented in LINUX by Oliver Kreylos at UC Davis, that we tried and failed to make.

To Jim Eigenreider at VT-Qualcomm Thinkabit Lab (at the West Falls Church campus of Virginia Tech) and the high school students that showed us how they implemented the LINUX version successfully.

To Thom Wolfe, and Rasmus Paulsen, who made and published the Windows version that we used, and provided useful advice. Here is more attribution from his readme file.

=====
Magic Sand is a software for operating an augmented reality sandbox like theAugmented Reality Sandbox developped by UC Davis.
It is a partial port of the SARndbox project of Oliver Kreylos under openframeworksand is also adapted from theofxKinectProjectorToolkit by Gene Kogan. It was ported to openframeworks byThomas Wolf and later modified and extended with some games by Rasmus R. Paulsen.

To NovaLabs for providing the environment and premises for the meetups that were catalyst to this implementation, the members that provided encouragement,transport, at site support, and facilitation of the Maker Faires that we have shown it at, and facilities for storage.

To NovaLabs Robotics team that hosted us in their lab while we were experimenting and building the sandbox

To Novalabs Ironwork and welding expert Sam Steele, who provided guidance to Elena Bachman in fabricating the frame she designed and made for the Sandbox.

To Elena for fabricating the frame and helping with integration.

To Sharon Dempsey, the driving force for implementing an Augmented Reality educational project and her management of it and contributions along the way.
